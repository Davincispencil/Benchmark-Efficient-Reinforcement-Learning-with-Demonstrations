# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Robotics
Efficient reinforcement learning for robotics control in simulation (_Reacher_ Environment).

Compare present methods for more efficient and robust RL training, including:

* Better Initialization (pre-trained with supervised learning);
* Residual Policy Learning;
* DDPG from Demonstrations;
* Reptile, MAML (across tasks);

## To Run:

* Python 3.5

* Pytorch & Tensorflow

## Benchmarks:

* DDPG, PPO for Reacher Environment in simulation
* Inverse Kinematics of Reacher Environment
* Supervised learning for intialization of DDPG, PPO
* Residual policy learning for intialization of DDPG, PPO
* Reptile + PPO, MAML + PPO
* DDPG from demonstrations
